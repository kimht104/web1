    <h2>Web란 무엇인가 ?</h2>
    <p>The Wayback Machine is a digital time capsule created by the Internet Archive .
      It is maintained with the content of Alexa Internet . Called the "three-dimensional index",
      the archive allows users to view web pages that have been preserved over time.
      Preserved web pages are released 6 to 12 months after they are saved. This is because the storage
      cycle is different. We don't track the website for every update, but we store it every few weeks.</p>
